# Scheduler

Application can be found at  https://bdcii.github.io/Scheduler/


## Objective
    My objective is to make a browser-based day-planner application that will allow a user to save tasks by the hour of the day. I am achieving this by using jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment. 


## Difficulties
Some of the difficulties I ran into:

-I had issues having the planner HTML elements display properly when using table elements.  When I decided to use <div> elements, it resolved many of my problems.

- Making sure my syntax for Moment was correct when I called upon it in different instances(past, present future tense, using it in loops,)



## Mockup

Functionality of the app should appear as - (./Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)
